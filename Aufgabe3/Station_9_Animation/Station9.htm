        <h1>Happy Yuletide!</h1>
        <p>
            Did you know it's Yuletide? <br>
            Prpbably not. Yule is between December 22 and January 2. It's celebrated with a Yule log, Yule goat, Yule boar and Yule singing. Sounds familiar? Well see who appropriated old Germanic traditions.<br>
            Also, celebrating Christmas (if you actually believe in God) in Winter doesn't make sense at all. (I mean the whole thing doesn't make sense but anyway)<br>
            Have fun!<br>
            All the Love, Mara
